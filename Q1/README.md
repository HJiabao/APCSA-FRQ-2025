## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Read Carefully
  
Part A
- Used a Variable to store dogs
- Figured out that I could just have 1 return statement if I use a "if" to change the variable if needed

Part B
-Use the correct loop
-Write my if statement then match it with the requirement 
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- No Changes
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Using Loops correctly
- Making the correct If statement
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Nothing of importance
